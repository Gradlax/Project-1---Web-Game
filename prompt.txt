Prompt: Let's Make a Browser Game!
Let's make an in-browser game to practice our skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Which game is up to you so long as you meet the requirements listed below. Almost any game will give us some great practice with DOM manipulation, events, and control flow.

What is a Browser Game?
A browser game is just a game that you play in your web browser! While you're free to pursue the traditional dungeon crawler, platformer, or shooter game, you don't need to be a traditional gamer in order to enjoy making a game. A game is anything that's playable! This definition includes things like trivia and quiz games, online board games, sports games, casino simulations, or children's interactive learning games. Here are a few examples!

Disclaimer: While it's great to look at existing games for inspiration, keep in mind that you have a limited amount of time and won't be able to do everything that you see in professionally developed online games!

Casino Simulations
A casino simulation would be any card, dice, or slot machine game that one would play at a casino. For example, check out this online blackjack game, 24/7 BlackJack. A game created in class doesn't need to have fancy animations like online versions-those can be a bonus or stretch goal!

Black Jack Web Game
Board Games
Many of us grew up playing board games like Monopoly, Checkers, Clue, Candyland, and so many others. These are all valid options for your project! For some inspiration, check out this checkers implementation on CoolMathGames.com.

Checkers Web Game
Trivia Games
Do you attend a weekly pub quiz? Is Jeopardy your jam? Are you the reigning champion of trivial pursuit? If you find yourself in the position of being less into traditional video games, it's worth noting that doing quiz games is a great option too that will give you a lot of great practice with DOM manipulation, managing your data, and tracking user input.

Requirements
General Requirements
This is a solo project!
Just to clarify, you may do the same game as another student, but you may not work together
This game cannot be a game or assignment we've already done in class
This game must run in a web browser
This game must be tracked in GitHub, with a minimum on 10 commits
Ideally, put your empty project up on GitHub on day one of development and aim for multiple commits per day
This game must be deployed on GitHub Pages or another location
Game Requirements
This game can be designed for 2 or more players (PvP) or 1 player (PvE)
The second player in a PvP game can be a person or an AI
For multi-player games, turns should switch appropriately between players
This game should be winnable or it should keep score (whichever makes more sense)
When a player wins or loses, the game status and/or score should display visually to the player in a way that does not rely on console.logs or alerts
If there is a valid draw (tie) condition in your chosen game, that should be implemented
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript should live in separate files
Effort must be spent on styling and appearance
The HTML code should use sematic tags
The game should have a Readme.md file in the GitHub repository that describes the inspiration for the game, explains the controls and how to play the game, lists the technologies used to build the game, and addresses any outstanding bugs or unfinished functionality
Bonus Ideas
Make persistent scores in your browser's localStorage
Add interesting music or sound effects to your game
Deliverables
A link to your game, which is deployed somewhere on the internet
A link to your GitHub repository, so we can see the progress on your game
Grading Scale
Games will be graded on a 1-5 scale in each of the following domains:

Domain

What are we looking for?

User Experience

Was effort put into styling? Is this a fun game to play? Are the controls intuitive?

Functionality

Is the game playable? Do all features work? Is there a win/lose/score condition?

Workflow

Did you use GitHub properly? Is there a readme?

Code Style

Does the code follow best practices/naming conventions? Is it DRY?

Presentation

Did the student present the project to the class? Is the site deployed where others can access?

The maximum score is 25 (achieved by getting a 5 in each of the domains). The minimum passing score is 15. For a more detailed explanation on what each score means, refer to the Grade Rubric.

Example Grade
Here is sample student Jane Lee's grade. Jane did great at functionality but ran out of time to do much styling for her game.

As you can see, she didn't get a 3 or higher in every individual area, but she scored high enough in other areas that she is more than passing.

Grade Interpretations
We're expecting that these milestone projects are going to be candidates for portfolio pieces that you may want to show off on a personal site or to a potential employer as a code example. You should assume any project with a limited time frame will need to be cleaned up, refactored, and DRYed out at a later time before it's ready to show others. Take note of code style improvements, commonly requested feature additions, and other suggestions to make your project the most impressive.

In the end, the project boils down to a pass/fail grade - either you score 15 or above or you don't. The scoring system is a nuance to help you understand your feedback and how your project will be perceived by potential employers and other industry professionals. The closer the score is to 25, the closer to ready it is to be a portfolio project. The closer to 15 it is, the more polishing up it may need. Pay attention to areas where you scored 4 or lower and make sure you understand why.

Non-Passing Projects
If your project is scored at 14 or below, it is expected that you will be resubmitting at a later due date according to the directions in your syllabus. Please note that there may be a limited number of resubmissions allowed. This information will be relayed to you in writing.

Tips on Getting Started
Thinking like a coder
Up to this point, the concepts you've learned may have seemed academic or theoretical. Now you're actually building a project of your own choosing. For grading purposes, we've set a couple limits and goals for you, but this is generally a "real-life scenario". Don't forget your earlier training.

Break down large tasks into smaller ones
Pseudocode!
Consider how you will store data associated with your game
Remember that time spent planning pays dividends!

Set up GitHub at the start
Even though you don't have anything to put into it yet, start out by making an empty git repository and then do all your work in there. Aim for multiple commits per day, ideally after you finish any small feature. Also, consider making an outline for your `readme.md` file as part of your planning process.

Commit early! Commit often!

Use those developer tools
Use console.log, alert, breakpoints, the inspector, and the debugger to get a glimpse of what's going on in your code. Know where to look to find errors and get used to interpreting common ones!

Know your documentation & sources
There are many places you can look for help and documentation:

Mozilla Developer Network- Documentation on JavaScript
jQuery- Documentation on jQuery if you choose to use it
MDN: CSS Reference- Documentation on CSS
W3Schools- Reference for HTML, CSS, and JS
CSS Tricks - A CSS Reference containing more advanced CSS topics

FAQ
Can I Use a Physics or Game Library like Phaser?
Maybe. We'd like to leave this to instructor discretion and should be approved on a case-by-case basis at the beginning of the project. Before asking your instructor about this, do some research and make sure it is something you think you'd enjoy doing for the duration of the project as well as something you believe you're ready to handle. Ensure you have a solid grasp on the fundamentals before attempting to go above and beyond the assignment. Libraries like Phaser tend to abstract code away from the DOM, which is cool, but it can result in you missing out on some of the reinforcement on recently learned concepts.

Can I make a 3D Game?
It's unlikely. We'll ultimately leave the choice up to your instructor, but for the most part, 3D games and game libraries aren't going to give you very much practice in using the DOM or the concepts learned in class this far. Don't get discouraged - with patience and a strong foundation in programming concepts, this will be within your reach soon!

Am I Allowed to Receive Help if I Get Stuck?
Yes! Your instructors will be available for questions during class time spent on projects and your TAs will be available during specified hours outside of class. If your instructors or TAs are busy helping someone else, feel free to reach out to a classmate too. After all, this reflects how you'll be collaborating with your peers in a real job!

A warning on over-relying on help: make sure you understand the explanation for any code someone else helps you write. Once you have the solution to something you were stuck on, make sure you understand it well enough to reproduce the solution without help. This will ensure that you have truly developed the skills that we're practicing and that you aren't accidentally cheating yourself out of knowledge that you deserve to have.

What Kind of Help Will I Receive?
The TAs and instructors are trained to give you hints about where to look for solutions rather than just handing you the answers. They probably aren't going to take over your machine and just start typing your project for you, and honestly you don't want them to. The goal of the program is to make you a self-sufficient programmer who is able to find resources and interpret documentation when needed. Think of your instructional team as gurus who have made the same journey that you are making now.

The TA is too Busy! What Should I Do?
Ideally, we want to have enough TA hours to help everyone who needs help. That said, some people may be monopolizing the TA's time. Generally it is best to notify the TA via a private message that you would like to be in line for help, otherwise they may naturally pay attention to whoever talks the most. If this becomes a persistent issue, it is important that you bring this up with the instructional team so that it can be determined whether more TA hours are needed or if a schedule needs to be put in place.
